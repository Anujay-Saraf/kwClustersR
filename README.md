# kwClustersR
This R package helps you to create clusters from a keyword list to speed up your SEO keyword research.
It uses the Jaro Winkler distance algorithm to create clusters. You can specify the cluster ratio to manage the size of your keywords groups. Try several ratio to adjust your keyword clusterisation.
        
The script is explained step by step on my blog post "[Clusteriser ses mots-cl√©s avec R](https://remibacha.com/clusteriser-mots-cles/) (French)"

## Install
```
devtools::install_github("remibacha/kwClustersR")
```

## Getting started
Load the following packages
```
library(kwClustersR)
library(readxl)
library(stringdist)
```

Load your keyword list into R. It should contain a column called "Keyword" with all your keywords in it. Check the [keyword_list.xlsx](https://github.com/remibacha/kwClustersR/blob/master/keyword_list.xlsx?raw=true) example.


```
pathxlsx <- '/Users/Downloads/keyword_list.xlsx'
df <-  read_excel(pathxlsx, sheet = 1, col_names = TRUE, na = "", skip=0)
```

Call the kwClustersR function by specified 2 arguments (your dataset, the clusters ratio)  and enjoy!
```
kwClustersR(df,0.9)
```

Don't forget to check the Plots tab in your R Studio. 2 graphics has been created here.
