# kwClustersR
This R script helps you to create clusters from a keyword list to speed up your SEO keyword research.
The script is fully explained on my blog post "[Clusteriser ses mots-cl√©s avec R](https://remibacha.com/clusteriser-mots-cles/) (French)"

## Getting started
You first need to have your keyword list into a file called keyword_list.xlsx. Keywords should be in a column called "Keyword".
Check the [keyword_list.xlsx](https://github.com/remibacha/kwClustersR/blob/master/keyword_list.xlsx?raw=true) example.

Copy and paste [the step3 script](https://github.com/remibacha/kwClustersR/blob/master/step3.R) into a new script in R Studio.
Replace the pathxlsx line with your own path.
Then run the script and enjoy!

## Install
